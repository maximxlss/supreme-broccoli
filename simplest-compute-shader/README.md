# simplest-compute-shader

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Numpy - `pip install numpy`
- moderngl - `pip install moderngl`

## Decription

Multiply two arrays on GPU!

Or more like just my first compute shader :3

I also want to shoutout to library used here, moderngl, it is REALLY simple to use, especially with compute shaders.

I wrote helpful comments (or I think they are helpful) so maybe this might help somebody start with compute shaders.
